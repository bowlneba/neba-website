# Code Standards

Before implementing or reviewing code, read `.github/instructions/pull-request-review.instructions.md` for PR review guidelines that apply to all code in this repository.

For detailed architectural context:

- Backend: `docs/architecture/backend.md` (or wherever you put ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Blazor: `docs/architecture/blazor.md`

## Workflow Preferences

- **Show, don't insert**: When suggesting code changes, display the implementation in the response for review rather than directly inserting it into files. Only insert code directly when explicitly requested.

## Self-Maintenance

This file is a **living document** and should be kept current as the project evolves. Both Claude and GitHub Copilot can leverage these learnings to provide better assistance.

When you discover something important during a session, update this file to capture:

- **Learnings**: Project-specific patterns, conventions, or gotchas discovered during work
- **Common fixes**: Solutions to recurring issues or errors
- **Preferences**: User workflow preferences expressed during conversations

Before ending a session where significant discoveries were made, consider whether they should be documented here for future reference.
