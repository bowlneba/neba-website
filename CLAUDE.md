# Code Standards

Before implementing or reviewing code, read `.github/instructions/pull-request-review.instructions.md` for PR review guidelines that apply to all code in this repository.

For detailed architectural context:

- Backend: `docs/architecture/backend.md` (or wherever you put ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Blazor: `docs/architecture/blazor.md`

## Workflow Preferences

- **Show, don't insert**: When suggesting code changes, display the implementation in the response for review rather than directly inserting it into files. Only insert code directly when explicitly requested.
